## What is MEV-Boost?

`mev-boost` is open source middleware run by validators to access a competitive block-building market. MEV-Boost was built by Flashbots as an implementation of [proposer-builder separation (PBS)](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725) for proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum.

With MEV-Boost, validators can access blocks from a marketplace of builders. Builders produce blocks containing transaction orderflow and a fee for the block proposing validator. Separating the role of proposers from block builders promotes greater competition, decentralization, and censorship-resistance for Ethereum.

## How does MEV-Boost work?


PoS node operators must run three pieces of software: a Validator client, a Consensus client, and an Execution client. MEV-boost is a sidecar for the Consensus client, a separate piece of open source software, which queries and outsources block-building to a network of builders. Block builders prepare full blocks, optimizing for MEV extraction and fair distribution of rewards. They then submit their blocks to relays.

Relays aggregate blocks from **multiple** builders in order to select the block with the highest fees. One instance of MEV-boost can be configured by a validator to connect to **multiple** relays. The Consensus Layer client of a validator proposes the most profitable block received from MEV-boost to the Ethereum network for attestation and block inclusion.

A MEV-Boost Security Assessment was conducted on 2022-06-20 by [lotusbumi](https://github.com/lotusbumi). Additional audits of surrounding infrastructure, such as the Flashbots relay, are currently underway.

## Who can run MEV-Boost?

MEV-Boost is a piece of software that any PoS Ethereum node operator (including solo validators) can run as part of their Beacon Client software. It is compatible with any Ethereum consensus client. Support and installation instructions for each client can be found [here](#installing).

# Background

MEV is a centralizing force on Ethereum. Unattended, the competition for MEV opportunities leads to consensus security instability and permissioned communication infrastructure between traders and block producers. This erodes neutrality, transparency, decentralization, and permissionlessness.

Proposer/block-builder separation (PBS) was initially proposed by Ethereum researchers as a response to the risk that MEV poses to decentralization of consensus networks. They have suggested that uncontrolled MEV extraction promotes economies of scale which are centralizing in nature, and complicate decentralized pooling.

Flashbots is a research and development organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of MEV. Flashbots started as a builder specializing in MEV extraction in proof-of-work Ethereum to democratize access to MEV and make the most profitable blocks available to all miners. >90% of miners are outsourcing some of their block construction to Flashbots today.

In the future, [proposer/builder separation](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980) will be enshrined in the Ethereum protocol itself to further harden its trust model.

# Installing

`mev-boost` can run in any machine, as long as it is reachable by the beacon client. The default port is 18550. The most common setup is to install it in the same machine as the beacon client.


## Binaries

Each release includes binaries from Linux, Windows and macOS (portable build, for amd and arm). You can find the latest release at
https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/releases


## From source

Requires [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### `go install`

Install mev-boost with `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/flashbots/mev-boost@latest
mev-boost -help
```

### Clone & build

clone the repository and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost.git
cd mev-boost
# Checkout the version you want to build based on tags - Example below for v1.3.1
# Releases are available at https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/releases
git checkout tags/v1.3.1
make build
# Use build-portable if the standard build crashes on startup
make build-portable
# Show the help. This confirms mev-boost is able to start
./mev-boost -help
```

## From Docker image

We maintain a mev-boost Docker images at https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/mev-boost

- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Pull & run the latest image:

```bash
# Get the default mev-boost image
docker pull flashbots/mev-boost:latest

# Get the portable mev-boost image
docker pull flashbots/mev-boost:latest-portable

# Run it
docker run flashbots/mev-boost -help
```

## Systemd configuration

You can run mev-boost with a systemd config (`/etc/systemd/system/mev-boost.service`) like this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=mev-boost
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=mev-boost
Group=mev-boost
WorkingDirectory=/home/mev-boost
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/home/mev-boost/bin/mev-boost \
		-mainnet \
		-relay-check \
		-relays YOUR_RELAY_CHOICE

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Troubleshooting

If mev-boost crashes with [`"SIGILL: illegal instruction"`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/256) then you need to use a portable build:

You can either use a [portable Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/mev-boost/tags), or install/build the portable build like this:

```bash
# using `go install`
CGO_CFLAGS="-O -D__BLST_PORTABLE__" go install github.com/flashbots/mev-boost@latest

# build from source
make build-portable
```


# Usage

A single mev-boost instance can be used by multiple beacon nodes and validators. 

Aside from running mev-boost on your local network, you must configure:
* each individual **beacon node** to connect to mev-boost. Beacon Node configuration varies by Consensus client. Guides for each client can be found on the [MEV-boost website](https://boost.flashbots.net/#block-356364ebd7cc424fb524428ed0134b21).
* each individual **validator** to configure a preferred relay selection. Note: validators should take precautions to only connect to trusted relays. Read more about the role of relays on the [Flashbots documentation](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/relays). A list of all available relays is maintained by [Ethstaker](https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/MEV-relay-list.md) and [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-call-for-relay-providers/2844).
