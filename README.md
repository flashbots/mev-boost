Template to bootstrap and configure new projects maintained by the Flashbots collective.

## Instructions

- Every project maintained by the Flashbots collective should have a comprehensive and clear README file that serves as an index.
  - Follow the [Standard Readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/master/spec.md) specification.
  - Read [Art of README](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme).
  - The other sections of this file can be used as a template to bootstrap a new repository.
  
- Suggested options:
  - Enable _Wikis_ for documentation if the instructions to use the project are too long to fit nicely in the README file. If the project is one of our top priorities, once it is public and stable move the documentation to the [Flashbots docs website](https://docs.flashbots.net/).
  - Enable _Issues_. Every task related to the project should be written as an issue. If the project is public, the issues should be a welcoming space to get feedback and bug reports from contributors.
  - Enable _Projects_ if the project is being actively developed.
  - Enable _Preserve this repository_.
  - Disable _Allow merge commits_.
  - Enable _Allow squash merging_. This makes commits clear and traceable to a pull request.
  - Disable _Allow rebase merging_.
  - Enable _Automatically delete head branches_.
  
- Suggested access:
  - Add at least two maintainers with the role _Admin_.
  - Add the _flashbots/engineering_ team with the role _Write_.

- Suggested branch protection for _main_:
  - Enable _Require a pull request before merging_.
  - Enable _Require approvals_ with 1 approval required.
  - Enable _Require status checks to pass before merging_.

- Copy the license to the [LICENSE file](LICENSE).

- Fill the contributing instructions in the [CONTRIBUTING file](CONTRIBUTING.md).
