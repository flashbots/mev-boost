A service that allows Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) clients to outsource block construction to third party block builders in addition to execution clients. See [ethresearch post](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177/) for the high level architecture and **[`docs/specification.md`](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/blob/main/docs/specification.md)** for the specification and implementation details.

## Build

```
make build
```

and then run it with:

```
./mev-boost
```

## Test

```
make test
```

## Lint

We use `revive` as a linter and [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/). You need to installÂ them with

```bash
go install github.com/mgechev/revive@latest
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@master
```

Lint and check the project:

```bash
make lint
```

## Running with mergemock

We are currently testing using a forked version of mergemock, see https://github.com/flashbots/mergemock

Make sure you've setup and built mergemock first, refer to its [README](https://github.com/flashbots/mergemock#quick-start) but here's a quick setup guide:

```
git clone -b v021-upstream https://github.com/flashbots/mergemock.git
cd mergemock
go build . mergemock
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lightclient/799c727e826483a2804fc5013d0d3e3d/raw/2e8824fa8d9d9b040f351b86b75c66868fb9b115/genesis.json
```

Then you can run an integration test with mergemock, spawning both a mergemock execution engine and a mergemock consensus client as well as mev-boost:

```
cd mev-boost
make run-mergemock-integration
```

The path to the mergemock repo is assumed to be `../mergemock`, you can override like so:

```
make MERGEMOCK_DIR=/PATH-TO-MERGEMOCK-REPO run-mergemock-integration
```

to run mergemock in dev mode:

```
make MERGEMOCK_BIN='go run .' run-mergemock-integration
```
