The list of error codes introduced by this specification can be found below.

| Code | Message | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| -32000 | Server error | Generic client error while processing request. |
| -32001 | Unknown hash | No block with the provided hash is known. |
| -32002 | Unknown validator | No known mapping between validator and feeRecipient. |
| -32003 | Invalid SSZ | Unable to decode SSZ. |
| -32004 | Unknown block | Block does not match the provided header. |
| -32005 | Invalid signature | Provided signature is invalid. |
| -32006 | Invalid timestamp | Provided timestamp was invalid. |
| -32600 | Invalid request | The JSON sent is not a valid Request object. |
| -32601 | Method not found | The method does not exist / is not available. |
| -32602 | Invalid params | Invalid method parameter(s). |
| -32603 | Internal error | Internal JSON-RPC error. |
| -32700 | Parse error | Invalid JSON was received by the server. |

## Routines

### Signing

All signature operations should follow the [standard BLS operations][bls] interface defined in `consensus-specs`.

There are two types of data to sign over in the Builder API:
* In-protocol messages, e.g. [`BlindBeaconBlock`](#blindbeaconblock), which should compute the signing root using [`compute_signing_root`][compute-signing-root] and use the domain specified for beacon block proposals.
* Builder API messages, e.g. [`builder_setFeeRecipientV1`](#builder_setFeeRecipientV1) and the response to [`builder_getHeader`](#response-2), which should compute the signing root using [`compute_signing_root`][compute-signing-root] and the domain `DomainType('0xXXXXXXXX')` (TODO: get a proper domain).

As `compute_signing_root` takes `SSZObject` as input, client software should convert in-protocol messages to their SSZ representation to compute the signing root and Builder API messages to the SSZ representations defined [above](#sszobjects).

## Methods

### `builder_setFeeRecipientV1`

#### Request

- method: `builder_setFeeRecipientV1`
- params:
  1. `message`: `object`
      1. `feeRecipient`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - Address of account which should receive fees.
      2. `timestamp`: `QUANTITY`, uint64 - Unix timestamp of announcement.
  2. `publicKey`: `DATA`, 48 Bytes - Public key of validator.
  3. `signature`: `DATA`, 96 Bytes - Signature over `feeRecipient` and `timestamp`.

#### Response

- result: `null`
- error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the payload.

#### Specification
1. Builder software **MUST** verify `signature` is valid under `publicKey`.
2. Builder software **MUST** respond to requests where `timestamp` is before the latest announcement from the validator with `-32006: Invalid timestamp`.
3. Builder software **MUST** store `feeRecipient` in a map keyed by `publicKey`.

### `builder_getHeaderV1`

#### Request

- method: `builder_getHeaderV1`
- params:
  1. `hash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - Hash of Execution Layer block which the validator intends to use as the parent for its proposal.

#### Response

- result: `object`
    - `message`: `object`
        - `header`: [`ExecutionPayloadHeaderV1`](#executionpayloadheaderv1).
        - `value`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - the payment in wei that will be directed to the `feeRecipient` account.
    - `publicKey`: `DATA`, 48 Bytes - the public key associated with the builder.
    - `signature`: `DATA`, 96 Bytes - BLS signature of the builder over `payload` and `value`.
- error: code and message set in case an exception happens while getting the payload.

#### Specification
1. Builder software **SHOULD** respond immediately with the `header` that increases the `feeRecipient`'s balance by the most.
2. Builder software **MUST** return `-32001: Unknown hash` if the block identified by `hash` does not exist.
3. Builder software **MUST** return `-32002: Unknown validator` if the validator the builder expects to propose in the current slot has not been mapped to a `feeRecipient`.
4. Builder software **MAY** set the `feeRecipient` for the block to a different address than the address mapped to the validator so long as a payment equal to `value` is made to `feeRecipient`.

### `builder_getPayloadV1`

#### Request

- method: `builder_getPayloadV1`
- params:
  1. `block`: `DATA`, arbitray length - SSZ encoded [`SignedBlindBeaconBlock`](#blindbeaconblock).

#### Response

- result: [`ExecutionPayloadV1`](#executionpayloadv1).
- error: code and message set in case an exception happens while proposing the payload.

#### Specification
1. Builder software **MUST** verify that `block` is an SSZ encoded [`SignBlindBeaconBlock`](#blindbeaconblock). If the block is encoded incorrectly, the builder **MUST** return `-32003: Invalid SSZ`. If the block is encoded correctly, but does not include a matching `ExecutionPayloadHeaderV1` provided from `builder_getHeaderV1`, the builder **SHOULD** return `-32004: Unknown block`.
2. Builder software **MUST** verify that `signature` is a BLS signature over `block` using [`verify_block_signature`][verify-block-signature] from the validator that is expected to propose in the given slot. If the signature is determined to be invalid or from a different validator than expected, the builder **MUST** return `-32005: Invalid signature`.
